Docker image with java8 and maven. Not intended to use as a base for Java projects, just for building.

Contents of .drone.yml:
```
pipeline:
  build:
    commands:
      - "/root/entrypoint.sh 'mvn clean install'"
    secrets:
      - artifactory_username
      - artifactory_password
    image: quay.io/ukhomeofficedigital/java8-mvn:v3.6.0
    when:
      event:
        - push
        - pull_request

```

To deploy artifacts to Artifactory, please pass valid credentials via the ARTIFACTORY\_USERNAME and ARTIFACTORY\_PASSWORD environment variables.

You'll also need to include the following in your POM file:
```
<distributionManagement>
        <repository>
                <id>artifactory</id>
                <name>libs-release-local</name>
                <url>https://artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/libs-release-local</url>
        </repository>
        <snapshotRepository>
                <id>artifactory</id>
                <name>libs-snapshot-local</name>
                <url>https://artifactory.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/artifactory/libs-snapshot-local</url>
        </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>
```
Maven should then deploy to Artifactory during the "deploy" lifecycle phase.
